Q1: CSS Box model
	All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

	The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

	When laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS box 
	model. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.
Q2: 
	em : The em is a scalable unit that is used in web document media. An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt.
	px : Pixels are fixed-size units that are used in screen media (i.e. to be read on the computer screen). One pixel is equal to one dot on the computer screen (the smallest division of your screen’s resolution).
	pt : Points are traditionally used in print media (anything that is to be printed on paper, etc.). One point is equal to 1/72 of an inch. Points are much like pixels, in that they are fixed-size units and cannot scale in size.
